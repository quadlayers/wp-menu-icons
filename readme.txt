WP Menu Icons allows you to add icons to your WordPress menu items.

== Description ==
[Premium](https://quadlayers.com/products/wp-menu-icons/) | [Documentation](https://quadlayers.com/products/wp-menu-icons/) | [QuadMenu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/quadmenu) | [Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/quadlayers/) | [Github](https://github.com/quadlayers/wp-menu-icons)

The site's menu can be as simple as a list of links without indentation, or as complex as a major feature within the site.

However, many developers strive to provide more complex features in their mega menu plugins, often overlooking users who only need a very basic function that isn't included in the default WordPress menu.

This is why we created WP Menu Icons, a plugin that doesn't claim to be the best premium WordPress plugin, but does what it's designed to do: it gives you the ability to incorporate icons into your WordPress menu.
